== Licence ==
radiPanel: RC3 (Edited) is licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 UK: England & Wales Licence, terms of which can be viewed at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/

== Installation ==
To install, simply upload using FTP or a file transfer program of your choice, create a MySQL database and visit the _installer directory - it's all downhill from there!

== Things To Note ==
- In order for a user to be able to view the panel, he *must* have the "User"
  usergroup selected - without it he'll be unable to access the core functions
  of the script!

- All frontend files are located in _frontend - they're deliberately simple
  and therefore easy to integrate into your site. Should you need any assistance
  with these just contact Josh on ClubHabbo Forum.

- To addon developers, if your addon isn't included it would probably be for one of the following reasons:
	
	i) Your addon release page doesn't mention a licence; or
	ii) Your addon licence included additional terms (such as right of removal on request); or
	iii) The licence your addon is released under is not compatible with the parent product licence.

  If you are a developer and your addon has been missed, please send a PM to iCame on clubhabboforum.net or create an
  issue over on the issue tracker at http://www.github.com/radiPanel-RC3 (requires registration) to find
  out the reasons for it's non inclusion.
